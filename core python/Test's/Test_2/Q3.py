# 3. A farmer has a field which is half in circle share and rest rectangle. He needs to do fencing
# for entire field using barbed wire 5 times. Circular section has radius 20m and rectangle
# length is 50 m and breadth is 40m. If cost of barbed wire is 35Rs/m then calculate the total
# cost of fencing the field.

radius=20
length=50
breadth=40

circumference=2*3.14*radius

perimeter=2*(length+breadth)

total_fencing= 5 * ( circumference + perimeter )

total_fencing_cost= total_fencing * 35
